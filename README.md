## Ian Simpson

After 25 years within various finance departments it took a year long stint as a Financial Controller at a digital agency to find a passion for coding. Over the years I've learnt a logical thought process integral with business finance, whether this be day to day running of a department or the improvement of process and systems. A drive to learn and immerse myself within coding/development led me to Makers Academy with a goal to make software development a new career.

## Skills

# Teamwork
My past employment has given me a good grounding for working within teams made up of technical and non-technical people, the Makers Academy experience has built on these skills through pair progamming and group projects. 

# A passion for learning
Each previous role has had a steep learning curve when trying to implement new systems and processes as with legacy code the output is understood (tested) so that small improvements can be implemented. Working on challeneges that try to mirror legacy code has been a revaltaion, I found them an enjoyable challenge. A small expample of this can be seen with our Gilded Rose Kata - I firstly ran the tests, read through the code to get an idea of output then created a golden master of tests to cover all possible outcomes before starting the refactoring process.

# Eye for detail
Working within finance has ensured that a high level of accuracy is kept at all times but maintaining clear readable information, something which has transferred well when writing clean readble code.

# Quick to learn
A good grounding in OOP through our understanding of Ruby has helped pick up other languages, week 5 we moved onto JavaSript with no prior knowledge and within a week I found a basic understanding and our week 10 project program to estimate if the following days FTSE index would got up or down using machine learning and Python, again a language I'd never used until that point.
