## Ian Simpson

After 25 years within various finance departments it took a year long stint as a Financial Controller at a digital agency to find a passion for coding. Over the years I've learnt a logical thought process integral with business finance, whether this be day to day running or the improvement of process and formats. A drive to learn and immerse myself within coding/development led me to Makers Academy with a goal to make development a new career.
